🎵 Vinyl Guardian
Vinyl Guardian is a custom Home Assistant Add-on that bridges the gap between your analog record player and your digital smart home.
By listening to the audio output of your turntable, Vinyl Guardian automatically detects when the needle drops, records a short snippet, identifies the song using Shazam, and publishes the track metadata natively to Home Assistant via MQTT. It even includes bulletproof, native Last.fm scrobbling that perfectly mimics digital media players.
✨ Features
Zero-Key Shazam Recognition: Uses the shazamio library to fingerprint and identify tracks completely free, with no API keys or rate limits to worry about.
Native Last.fm Scrobbling: Built-in Last.fm integration that strictly follows official scrobbling rules (waits for 50% of the track duration or 4 minutes of continuous physical playtime).
Smart Needle-Lift Detection: If you lift the needle halfway through a song, the Add-on detects the silence and instantly aborts the scrobble to prevent false logs.
MQTT Auto-Discovery: Automatically creates beautiful, dedicated sensors in your Home Assistant dashboard without any manual YAML configuration.
Audio Health Monitoring: Actively monitors the audio stream and warns you in the Add-on logs if your audio is clipping or too quiet.
UI Volume Control: Adjust your physical soundcard's input volume directly from the Home Assistant Add-on configuration screen.
🛠️ Prerequisites
Hardware: A USB soundcard, audio capture device, or direct line-in connected to your Home Assistant host machine. You will need to route your turntable/pre-amp output into this input.
Software: An active MQTT Broker (like the official Mosquitto broker Add-on) running in Home Assistant.
